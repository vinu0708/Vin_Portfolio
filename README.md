# Project 1: What Is a Full Stack Developer?
In the world of software programming, it helps to have someone on the team who is something of a jack of all trades. They can help with various stages of development and have the versatility and time management to assist all levels of the development team. When it comes to web development, that role belongs to the Full Stack Developer. This is not a Back End or Front End developer, but someone who handles both — a “Full Stack,” as it were.

# Project 2: What Does a Full Stack Developer Do?
A Full Stack Developer is someone who works with the Back End — or server side — of the application as well as the Front End, or client side. Full Stack Developers have to have some **skills in a wide variety of coding niches**, from databases to graphic design and UI/UX management in order to do their job well. They are something of a swing, ready to assist wherever needed in the process.

## Some of the responsibilities of a Full Stack Developer include:
- Helping with the design and development of software
- Testing and debugging software to keep it optimized
- Writing clean code for the front and back end of the software
- Designing user interactions on the web application itself
- Creating servers and databases for the back end of the software
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility and optimization
- Testing and maintaining the responsive design of applications
- Working with graphic designers to design new features
- Developing APIs and RESTful services
- Keeping up with technological advances to optimize their software
- Communicating effectiveness of emerging technologies to decision makers
- Considering security, maintenance, scalability, and more when developing

# Project 3: When Is a Full Stack Developer Needed?
It depends on the size and scalability of the software. For instance, a small independent game group made up of only a few people creating a small simulator could have one Back End Developer and one Front End Developer and that might be all they need for the development. If they’re even smaller, they might have one Full Stack Developer who **handles the entire application**. On the other hand, a large web application with strong potential for scaling will require many hands on deck — Back End, Front End, and Full Stack Developers.
